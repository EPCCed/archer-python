    "## Scientific Python: Computational Fluid Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise takes an example from one of the most common\n",
    "applications of HPC resources: Fluid Dynamics. We will look\n",
    "at how a simple fluid dynamics problem can be run using\n",
    "Python and numpy; and how Fortran and/or C code can be\n",
    "called from within Python. The exercise will compare the performance of the different approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use this exercise to demonstrate the use of matplotlib to plot a visualisation of the simulation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise aims to use:\n",
    "* Python lists and functions\n",
    "* Basic numpy array manipulation\n",
    "* Plotting using matplotlib\n",
    "* Calling Fortran/C from Python\n",
    "* Benchmarking Python performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fluid Dynamics: a brief overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Fluid Dynamics is the study of the mechanics of fluid flow, liquids and gases in motion. This can encompass aerodynamics\n",
    "and hydrodynamics. It has wide ranging applications from\n",
    "vessel and structure design to weather and traffic modelling. Simulating and solving fluid dynamic problems often requires\n",
    "large computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fluid dynamics is an example of continuous system that can be described by Partial Differential Equations. For a computer to simulate these systems, the equations must be discretised onto a grid. If this grid is regular, then a finite difference approach can be used. Using this method means that the value at any point in the grid is updated using some combination of the neighbouring points.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Discretisation_ is the process of approximating a continuous (i.e. infinite-dimensional) problem by a finite-dimensional problem suitable for a computer. This is often accomplished by putting the calculations into a grid or similar construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise the finite difference approach is used to determine the flow pattern of a fluid in a cavity. For simplicity, the liquid is assumed to have zero viscosity, which implies that there can be no vortices (i.e. no whirlpools) in the flow. The cavity is a square box with an inlet on one side and an outlet on another as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./box.png\" style=\"float: center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical background\n",
    "\n",
    "In two dimensions it is easiest to work with the stream function\n",
    "$\\psi$ (see below for how this relates to the fluid velocity). For zero viscosity, $\\psi$ satisfies the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla^2 \\psi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The finite difference version of this equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\psi_{i-1,j} + \\psi_{i+1,j} + \\psi_{i,j-1} + \\psi_{i,j+1}\n",
    "-4 \\psi_{i,j} = 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With the boundary values fixed, the stream function can be calculated for each point in the grid by averaging the value\n",
    "at that point with its four nearest neighbours. The process continues until the algorithm converges on a solution that\n",
    "stays unchanged by the averaging process. This simple approach\n",
    "to solving a PDE is called the Jacobi algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to obtain the flow pattern of the fluid in the cavity\n",
    "we want to compute the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(x,y)$. The $x$ and $y$ components of the velocity are related to the stream function by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_x =  \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\psi_{i,j+1} - \\psi_{i,j-1}),\n",
    "\\quad\n",
    "u_y = -\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\psi_{i+1,j}-\\psi_{i-1,j}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the velocity of the fluid at each grid point\n",
    "can also be calculated from the surrounding grid points. The magnitude of the velocity $\\mathbf{u}$ is\n",
    "given by $u = (u_x^2 + u_y^2)^{1/2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of the algorithm for calculating the velocities is\n",
    "as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Set the boundary values for stream function\n",
    "while (convergence is FALSE):\n",
    "     for each interior grid point:\n",
    "         update the stream function\n",
    "     \n",
    "     compute convergence criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "for each interior grid point:\n",
    "    compute x component of velocity\n",
    "    compute y component of velocity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, here we simply run the calculation for a fixed number of iterations; a real simulation would continue until\n",
    "some chosen accuracy was achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using python\n",
    "\n",
    "This calculation is useful to look at in Python for a number of reasons:\n",
    "* It requires the use of 2-dimensional lists/arrays\n",
    "* The algorithm can easily be implemented in Python, NumPy,    Fortran and C\n",
    "* Visualising the results demonstrates the use of matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a basic code that uses Python lists to run the simulation. There are a number of different files:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cfd.py           # python driver script\n",
    "jacobi.py        # Jacobi algorthm code\n",
    "plot_flow.py     # separate script to plot flow\n",
    "util.py          # utility functions\n",
    "```\n",
    "Two additional files are provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cfdvort.py       # version with finite Reynolds Number\n",
    "jacobivort.py    # corresponding Jacobi code\n",
    "```\n",
    "These files are provided for interest, and involve a slightly\n",
    "different formulation of the same problem. They are not required to do the basic\n",
    "exercises described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the structure of the `cfd.py` code. In particular, note:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How the external \"jacobi\" function is included\n",
    "* How the lists are declared and initialised to zero\n",
    "* How the timing works\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Run and Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "First, verify that your copy of the code is producing the correct results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the python subdirectory and run the main program with:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "prompt:~/python> ./cfd.py 1 1000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This runs the CFD simulation with a scale factor of 1 and 1000 Jacobi iteration steps. As the program is running you should see output that looks something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2D CFD Simulation\n",
    "=================\n",
    "Scale factor = 1\n",
    "Iterations   = 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid size = 32 x 32\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting main Jacobi loop ...\n",
    "\n",
    "completed iteration 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "... finished\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation took 1.11856s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The program will produce two text output files called\n",
    "`velocity.dat` and `colourmap.dat` with the computed velocities\n",
    "at each grid point, and data providing a representation of the velocity magnitude, respectively. A simple verification is to use diff to compare your output with one of the verification datasets. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "prompt:~> diff velocity.dat ../verify/cfd_velocity_1_1000.dat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`diff` will only produce any output if it finds any differences between the two files. If you see any differences at this point, please ask a tutor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "Now produce some baseline figures with which to compare your future versions of the code. You should pick a set of representative problem sizes (defined by scale and number of iterations) that run in a sensible time on your machine but do\n",
    "not complete instantaneously. (A good place to start is with scale factor 2 and 5000 iterations. You will also need some smaller and larger examples.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Record the benchmarking calculation times for future reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The directory includes a utility called `plot_flow.py` that produces a graphical representation of the final state of the simulation. You can use this to produce a PNG image as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "prompt:~> ./plot_flow.py velocity.dat colourmap.dat flow.png\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./output.png\" style=\"float: center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "If the fluid is flowing around the edge of the domain, rather than through the middle of the cavity, then this is an indication that the Jacobi algorithm has not yet converged. Convergence requires more iterations on larger problem sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using numpy arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now re-factor the CFD code to use numpy arrays rather than Python lists. This has a number of advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* numpy is closely integrated with matplotlib and using numpy arrays will allow us to produce the visualisation directly from our simulation rather than using a separate utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "* numpy arrays should allow us to access better performance using more concise code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* numpy arrays are directly compatible with native code produced by Fortran and C compilers. This will allow us to re-code the key part of our algorithm and achieve better performance while still having the benefits of coding in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace the `psi` and `tmp` lists in the code with numpy arrays. (It may be useful to make a copy of the code in a new directory before you start work so you can refer to the unaltered original version.) You will need the statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "at the top of all your source files to ensure you can access the numpy functionality. The arrays will need to be implemented in the main function and all of the other functions where they are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Declaring and zeroing numpy arrays can be done in a single statement such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "psi = np.zeros((m+2, n+2))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you think you have the correct code, run your new program and compare the output with that from the original code. If you are convinced that the output is the same then move on and benchmark your new code.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you find? Has using numpy arrays increased the performance of the code? Can you think of an explanation of why the performance has altered in the way that it has?\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you change the implementation to produce a better performing version of the CFD code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 1: which method of accessing 2D array elements is faster: `a[i][j]` or `a[i,j]`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 2: you should use array index syntax (or _slicing_) if you have not already done so to specify blocks of arrays to operate on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Incorporating matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "The packages `matplotlib` and `numpy` have a very close relationship: `matplotlib` can use the type and structure of numpy `arrays` to simplify the plotting of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the working numpy version of the CFD program we will use `matplotlib` to add a function that produces an image of the final state of the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define a plotting function\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a function in your main `cfd.py` file called, e.g., `plot_flow()`. This function should take two arguments: the first is `psi` the `numpy` array containing the stream function values and the second is the name of the file in which to save the image. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def plot_flow(psi, outfilename):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function should use the stream function values to compute the $x$\n",
    "and $y$ components of the velocities and the magnitude of the velocity and store them in appropriate numpy arrays. Remember, you will need to extract the velocities of the internal part of the matrix and exclude the fixed boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should import the required matplotlib functionality with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest plot to produce is a heatmap of the magnitude of the velocity. You can use the imshow function to do this in a single line. Assuming that the velocity magnitudes are in a numpy array called `umag`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.imshow(umag)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Check the documentation to find out how to control the colour scheme\n",
    "(a default will be selected).\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce the image file we need to add one further line. Remember\n",
    "that you can select the format of the file via the file name extension,\n",
    "e.g., `outfile.png`, `outfile.pdf` and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig.savefig(outfilename)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now start to add more features to make the plot for informative\n",
    "(these additions should come before `fig.savefig()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a colour bar to quantify the colour scale:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.colorbar()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Add streamlines indicating the direction of the flow; here, you will\n",
    "first need to set up regularly spaced values to describe the grid. Set\n",
    "up the $x$ and $y$ ranges via\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# m and n are the extent of the x-direction and y-direction\n",
    "x = np.linspace(1,m-1,m)\n",
    "y = np.linsapce(1,n-1,n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the online documentation if you need to confirm what this does.\n",
    "Once you have these values you can use the matplotlib `streamplot()` function to add streamlines. If the $x$ and $y$ components of the\n",
    "velocity are `ux` and `uy` then we may write, e.g.,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.streamplot(x, y, ux, uy, color = 'k', density = 1.5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `density` parameter controls the number of streamlines plotted\n",
    "in unit area.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `scipy`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have found that the `numpy` implementation that simply\n",
    "iterates using explicit `range()` loops does not much improve\n",
    "performance compared with bare python lists. The implementation\n",
    "using slicing will give better performance (why?). However, the\n",
    "indexing version is probably harmful to readability: more complex\n",
    "code could become unweildy and difficult to understand/maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `scipy` function `convolve()` provides one way to improve\n",
    "performance and maintain readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a version of the `jacobi.py` routine that uses the `convolve()`\n",
    "function and assess its performance against your previous versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note you will need to define the mask to use for the convolution. This is essentially a stencil that you place over the current element that describes how to combine the surrounding elements to produce the required operation. To write this version of the function you will need to design your stencil and express it in the code as a 2D numpy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the online reference documentation for `convolve()` to work out how to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using just-in-time compilation with numba\n",
    "\n",
    "One other way to improve performance and maintain readability is to\n",
    "use the `numba` packages\n",
    "\n",
    "The anaconda distribution comes with the numba package, so we can try just-in-time compilation via the decorator `@jit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can try, e.g.,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from numba import jit\n",
    "\n",
    "@jit(nopython = True)\n",
    "def jacobi(niter, psi):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "What happens? Can you refactor the code to get the compilation to work? How does the time compare with, e.g., the sliced version of the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling external code from python\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to continue using our `numpy` implementation of the\n",
    "CFD code to illustrate calling Fortran/C code from Python.\n",
    "(You might prefer to try another language.) Calling\n",
    "any external code (written in any language) from Python requires\n",
    "* data passing from python has a known size and layout\n",
    "* the external routines have an interface which can be imported in python\n",
    "\n",
    "We must also have an appropriate compiler. Most platforms will allow\n",
    "the installation of and least GNU C and Fortran compilers. (Mac users\n",
    "may need to install e.g., Xcode; Windows users may install MinGW-w64.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `numpy` arrays will help to ensure that data can be passed\n",
    "correctly to and from python. The python package `f2py` provides\n",
    "one simple way to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using C and ctypes\n",
    "\n",
